# Types of Instances in AWS

AWS EC2 instances are grouped into families based on their purpose.

## 1. General Purpose
Balanced compute, memory, and networking.  
**Examples:** `t4g`, `t3`, `m6g`, `m5`  
**Use cases:** Web servers, development, small databases.

## 2. Compute Optimized
High CPU performance.  
**Examples:** `c7g`, `c6g`, `c5`  
**Use cases:** Batch processing, gaming servers, scientific modeling.

## 3. Memory Optimized
Large amounts of RAM for memory-heavy apps.  
**Examples:** `r7g`, `r6g`, `x2idn`  
**Use cases:** In-memory databases, big data analytics.

## 4. Storage Optimized
High storage throughput and IOPS.  
**Examples:** `i4i`, `d3`, `h1`  
**Use cases:** Data warehousing, NoSQL databases, Hadoop.

## 5. Accelerated Computing
GPUs or special hardware for advanced workloads.  
**Examples:** `p4`, `g5`, `f1`  
**Use cases:** Machine learning, 3D rendering, custom hardware acceleration.
