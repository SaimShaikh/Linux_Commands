# Understanding Partitions in Linux Volume Management

## 📌 What is a Partition?
A **partition** is a logical division of a physical storage device (like an EBS volume or a hard drive).  
Instead of using the entire disk as one large unit, partitions allow you to split it into smaller, independent sections.  
Each partition acts as if it were a separate disk, with its own filesystem and mount point.

Example device names:
- Whole disk: `/dev/nvme1n1`
- Partition: `/dev/nvme1n1p1`

## ❓ Why Do We Use Partitions?
1. **Organization of Data**  
   Keep system files, application files, and user data in separate areas.
2. **Different File Systems**  
   Use different file systems (e.g., ext4, xfs) for different needs.
3. **Security & Isolation**  
   Limit damage from corruption or malware to just one partition.
4. **Multi-Boot Configurations**  
   Run multiple operating systems on the same physical disk.
5. **Efficient Backups & Recovery**  
   Backup or restore only the relevant partition instead of the whole disk.

## ⚙️ How to Create a Partition (Linux)
> Example: Creating a partition on an AWS EBS volume

1. **List available disks**
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

 2. **Open the disk in fdisk**
    ```bash
    sudo fdisk /dev/<disk name>
    ```
3. **Inside fdisk**
-Press n → create new partition
-Choose primary or extended
-Accept defaults or set custom size
-Press w → write changes and exit
