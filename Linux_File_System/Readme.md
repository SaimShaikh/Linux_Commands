# 📁 Linux Directory Structure Explained
### What is a File System? A file system is a way the operating system organizes and stores files on a disk. Think of it like a big cupboard, where each drawer and shelf has its own purpose and place.
| Directory | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/` | 🌳 Root directory – everything starts from here | 🏡 Like the **main gate of a house**, from where you enter different rooms. |
| `/bin` | 🔧 Essential binary commands (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) | 🧰 Like a **toolbox** with daily-use tools like a hammer, screwdriver, etc. |
| `/boot` | 🚀 Stores files needed to boot the computer (Linux kernel, bootloader) | 🔑 Like the **ignition key of your car**, without it, the car won’t start. |
| `/etc` | ⚙️ Holds system and software configuration files | 📜 Like a **rulebook** in your house for controlling lights, AC, and more. |
| `/home` | 🏠 Personal folders for each user (e.g., `/home/saime`) | 🛏️ Like your own **bedroom**, with other bedrooms for other users. |
| `/lib` | 🛠️ Contains libraries needed by programs and commands | 🔩 Like the **spare parts** that your tools need to work properly. |
| `/media` | 💽 Mount points for removable media (USB drives, CDs) | 👜 Like **spots where you temporarily place your shopping bags or guest luggage**. |
| `/opt` | 🎁 For optional or third-party software installed later | 🎈 Like **gift boxes** or **special equipment** you bring into your house. |
| `/root` | 🔑 Home directory for the root (admin) user | 🚪 Like the **owner's private room**, where no one else is allowed without permission. |
| `/sbin` | 🛡️ System administration commands for the root user | ⚒️ Like the **admin’s toolbox**, used only by the system manager. |
| `/tmp` | 🗑️ Temporary files; cleared on reboot | ⏳ Like a **temporary storage table or dustbin**, used for short-term things. |
| `/usr` | 📚 User-installed software, documentation, and libraries | 🛋️ Like your **bookshelf** and appliance storage, where your things are kept neatly. |
| `/var` | 📂 Variable files such as logs, mail, and cache | 📬 Like your **mailbox** or a **room where letters and newspapers** arrive daily. |
